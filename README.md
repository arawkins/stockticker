### React Stock Ticker

React stock ticker is a basic re-creation of the classic board game Stock Ticker. I built it to get some hands on time with React and learn how React works.

## How to Play

The rules of the game are pretty simple. Stock prices go up and down randomly, by 5, 10, or 15 dollars per share. If a stock is valued at $100 or more per share, it will sometimes pay you dividends. The more shares you own, the bigger the dividends you can earn.

If a stock hits $200 / share, the stock will split. Your shares will double, and the price per share will be reset to $100.

If a stock hits $0 / share, it will crash and be taken off the market. All your shares in that stock are lost, and the price per share will be reset to $100.

I don't actually recall how you would win the board game. I just remember endlessly playing it with my friends and then getting really angry about the dice rolls :)
